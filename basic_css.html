        <h2>Basic info</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -->
            In 2002, &copy; halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' 
            Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, 
            and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[6] Later in his career, 
            Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World 
            Cup appearances for India.[7] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 
            2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa.

       <h2>Captaincy</h2>
       <p class="captaincy">Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful.
        When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations.
        However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying
        "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[107] which translates into
        : "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!"</p>

       <h2>Career</h2>
       <p id="sachin_career">
            
            Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 
            against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically
             and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, 
             Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, 
             behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.

       <h2>School Life</h2>
       <p id="sachin_school_life">
          
            Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his 
            schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a 
            school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. 
            Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra
             (East).[43] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings
              and evenings
       </p>
       <h2>World Cup</h2>
       <p class="sachin_text sachin_text_color sachin_world_cup">
            Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[129] helping India
            reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999,
            Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[130][131]

            He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a
            tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[132][133] As a part-time bowler, 
            he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final
